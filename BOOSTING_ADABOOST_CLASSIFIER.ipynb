        "#What is Adaboost boosting technique?\n",
        "\n",
        "In adaboost we generally try to convert the weak learners into strong learners by initially assigning sample weights and using decision trees. The formula for assigning the sample weights include:\n",
        "1/n here n is the total number of records present in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "In adaboost the decision treea are also called the base learners and should onlhy contain the depth of 1 and are also called as stumps.. so we create multiple decision trees from the features present in our dataset and then we check the best decision tree that is having lower entropy and high information gain.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now after selecting the best tree we see the degree of accuracy of the classification the tree has performed based on the targets. If say the tree classified 90% of the records correctly but failed to classify the 10% properly then, we find out the total error for the incorrectly classified model and try to update the weights to reduce the error...\n",
        "\n",
        "The formula foer finding out the total error is total errors/ no. of sample weights.\n",
        "\n",
        "After finding the total error we basically try to find out the performance of the stump using the formula:\n",
        "\n",
        "1/2 loge(1-Total error/Total error)\n",
        "\n",
        "Now the updation of weights is carried out, this is carried out in such a way that we decrease the weights of the correctly classified records and increase the weights of the wrongly classified records.\n",
        "\n",
        "so for updating the weights we use the formula for wrongly classifed ones as:\n",
        "\n",
        "previous weight * e^performance\n",
        "\n",
        "for correctly classified ones the formula goes as:\n",
        "\n",
        "previous weight * e^-performance\n",
        "\n",
        "Now after finding the updated weights we see that if the summation is coming out to be 1, if it is not coming 1 then we normalize the updated weights so that our summation becomes 1. The formula for normalization is given as:\n",
        "\n",
        "each updated weight value / summation of the values of the updated weights\n",
        "\n",
        "Next step is to again use the concept of forming the decision trees but to so we need to divide the normalized weights in the form of buckets having some specific size which is given as 0-the first normlaized value, first normalized value to the summation of first and second normalized value weights and so on....\n",
        "\n",
        "after this a random sampling will be done by the model and it will check the bucket in which the sample is present and based on that it will form the new dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "After the new dataset is formed again the process of stumps and error minimization through weight updation will be carried out and the process will go on till the time all the decision trees are not covered and the error rate is not minimized. \n",
        "\n",
        "Now for classification of the test dataset the model will look at the stumps and will take the majority vote of the target and will return the same as output whereas in case of regression mainly the mean value from all the decision tree stumps are taken and returned to the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Adaboost requires users specify a set of weak learners (alternatively, it will randomly generate a set of weak learner before the real learning process). It will learn the weights of how to add these learners to be a strong learner. The weight of each learner is learned by whether it predicts a sample correctly or not. If a learner is mispredict a sample, the weight of the learner is reduced a bit. It will repeat such process until converge.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In the case of Adaboost the same process of updation of weights is done but here in addition we decrease the value of the weights of the strong learners and increase the value of weak learners at successful trees and based on the same criteria as was used in XGBOOST we try to reduce the error by updating the weights and the output is predicted by looking at the frequencies of the successful trees.\n",
        "\n",
        "in adaboost the loss and perforance are the parameters that are taken into account for updating the weights. Also the concept of normalizing the updated weights to give a summation of 1 is also carried out.\n"
